Hallo! I am Justin P. Dickerson (GitHub: dj911ice) a software enginee.

The name of this app is called nameofapp (a bit of joke one must say...) locally and mytestappjpd on Heroku 
(https://mytestappjpd.herokuapp.com), and is my first application! Purpose of this application is to showcase 
rails: 5.1.3 with the latest ruby: 2.4.1p111 and my abilities as a web developer/applications engineer. Have an idea for the current application or notice a bug? 
Then use the application's contact form, if not able then email me at justin.p.dickerson@gmail.com. 
Wanna do a pull request or pair programming? Then sure, just send an email with the appropriate subject line!

Update: Postgresql 14.2 is the new development database!
Update: Application upgraded tp ruby 3.0.0 and rails 7.0.2.2!

Have an awesome day!
