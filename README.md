Hallo! I am Justin P. Dickerson, a professional web applications developer/engineer utilizing the Ruby on Rails stack.

The name of this app is called nameofapp (a bit of joke one must say...) locally and mytestappjpd on Heroku (https://mytestappjpd.herokuapp.com), and is my first application! Purpose of this application is to showcase rails 5.0 framework and my abilities as a web developer/applications engineer. Thus all assests used are strictly for testing and showcasing purposes.
